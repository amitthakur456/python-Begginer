# 🗺️ Python Learning Roadmap (Beginner to Advanced)

This roadmap will guide you step by step through the skills and topics you need to become proficient in Python — whether your goal is automation, web development, data science, or general programming.

---

## ✅ 1. **Basics of Python**

> Learn the core syntax and how Python works.

* ✅ Installing Python & Setting Up IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, or Thonny)
* ✅ Running Your First Script (`print("Hello, world!")`)
* ✅ Comments and Indentation
* ✅ Variables and Data Types
* ✅ Input/Output
* ✅ Operators (Arithmetic, Logical, Comparison)

📂 Sample Files:

* `01_hello_world.py`
* `02_variables.py`

---

## 🔁 2. **Control Flow**

> Make decisions and repeat actions in your code.

* ✅ `if`, `elif`, `else` Statements
* ✅ `for` and `while` Loops
* ✅ `break`, `continue`, and `pass`
* ✅ Boolean Logic

📂 Sample Files:

* `03_conditionals.py`
* `04_loops.py`

---

## 🔣 3. **Functions and Modules**

> Reuse code and break programs into reusable blocks.

* ✅ Defining and Calling Functions
* ✅ Function Parameters and Return Values
* ✅ Built-in Functions
* ✅ `import` and Using Modules

📂 Sample Files:

* `05_functions.py`

---

## 📦 4. **Data Structures**

> Store, organize, and manipulate data efficiently.

* ✅ Lists and List Methods
* ✅ Tuples
* ✅ Dictionaries
* ✅ Sets
* ✅ Looping Through Data Structures

📂 Sample Files:

* `06_lists.py`
* `07_dictionaries.py`

---

## 📂 5. **File Handling**

> Read from and write to files.

* ✅ Reading and Writing Text Files
* ✅ Working with Paths
* ✅ File Modes (`r`, `w`, `a`, `rb`, etc.)
* ✅ Context Managers (`with open(...)`)

📂 Sample Files:

* `file_read_write.py`

---

## 🧯 6. **Error Handling**

> Catch and handle runtime errors gracefully.

* ✅ `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`
* ✅ Common Exceptions
* ✅ Raising Exceptions

📂 Sample Files:

* `error_handling.py`

---

## 🔁 7. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

> Learn to structure code using classes and objects.

* ✅ Classes and Objects
* ✅ `__init__()` Constructor
* ✅ Instance and Class Attributes
* ✅ Inheritance and Polymorphism

📂 Sample Files:

* `classes_objects.py`

---

## 🧪 8. **Testing and Debugging**

> Ensure your code works as expected.

* ✅ `print()` Debugging
* ✅ Using `pdb`
* ✅ Writing Unit Tests with `unittest` or `pytest`

---

## 🌐 9. **Working with Libraries and Packages**

> Use Python’s ecosystem to expand your capabilities.

* ✅ Installing Packages with `pip`
* ✅ Popular Libraries:

  * `requests` (HTTP Requests)
  * `datetime` (Dates and Times)
  * `os`, `sys` (System and File Operations)

---

## 🧠 10. **Intermediate to Advanced Topics**

> Dive deeper into Python and specialize.

* 🔸 List Comprehensions
* 🔸 Lambda Functions
* 🔸 Decorators
* 🔸 Generators and Iterators
* 🔸 Regular Expressions
* 🔸 Virtual Environments (`venv`)
* 🔸 Using `argparse` for CLI tools

---

## 🧪 11. **Optional Paths (Specializations)**

Choose based on your goals:

### 📊 Data Science & Machine Learning

* `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

### 🌐 Web Development

* `Flask` or `Django`, HTML/CSS, APIs

### 🔧 Automation & Scripting

* `os`, `shutil`, `subprocess`, `pyautogui`

### 🎮 Game Development

* `pygame`, basic game loops

---

## 📘 Final Projects Ideas

* ✅ Todo List CLI App
* ✅ Currency Converter
* ✅ Web Scraper with `BeautifulSoup`
* ✅ Number Guessing Game
* ✅ Weather App using an API
